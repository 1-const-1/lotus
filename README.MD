RAW PROJECT

You need to follow the steps below to get the application running properly, but first let me describe what you can do here.

Don't forget to install all the necessary node_modules.

Okay... let's talk about the interactive parts:

/a - * allows you to enter the admin dashboard, and you can register (DO NOT USE YOUR REAL DATA), you will interact with my test DB.

/a/dashboard - * allows you to do something, just try clicking something.

/account - does the same as (/a), but only for consumers or participants.

/participant - is a user environment for interacting with all available trading rooms.
